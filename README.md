## Git Merge Practice

This is a practice repo set up for the 08082022 Data Science cohort to practice branches, Git merges, and merge conflicts.

This is at least partly a lesson in what NOT to do.

1. Step one, clone this repo! Don't fork it, just straight clone it.
2. Step two, make a new branch named after yourself. 
    git branch <your-name-here>
3. STOP
4. LISTEN
5. checkout that new branch
6. Open jupyter notebook, and add something, delete something, or in someway change some thing in the MainNotebook provided
7. Make a new notebook called 'your-name-notebook', replacing your-name with your name, of course.
8. git add the MainNotebook and your new notebook, then git commit those changes with an appropriate comment.
9. STOP
10. LISTEN
11. Push ONLY YOUR BRANCH to the origin
    git push origin <your-branch>    
12. open this link: https://github.com/JulianWard147/Git-Merge-Example
13. Navigate over to the branches
